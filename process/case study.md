# Google Tasks Redesign

## Preface
About 5 months ago I discovered the Google tasks app. I am a massive fan of the new style they are going for and wanted to use it as my todo app for a while. However there were a few issues I had with it such as the lack of reoccurring events. However more pressingly there was no desktop app. I am someone who works constantly on a desktop or laptop and I do not typically like to have my phone with me when working, furthermore I do not like distractions thus the mixed application style Google has started making with tasks off to one side and gmail or Google calendar in focus does not work for me. So the lack of a way to access google tasks independently of anything else was the last nail in the coffin. Which is a real shame because this app looks beautiful.
